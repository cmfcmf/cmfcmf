### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently mainly working on 
- [free-pdk](https://github.com/free-pdk): Reverse Engineering of [Padauk](http://www.padauk.com.tw/) mikrocontrollers.
- [cmfcmf/train-game](https://github.com/cmfcmf/train-game): A train game where you can drive a train around **all** of Germany, based on map data from OpenStreetMap and other data from German government institutions. 
- [cmfcmf/ic-pinout-diagram-generator](https://github.com/cmfcmf/ic-pinout-diagram-generator): An interactive pinout diagram generator for integrated circuits.
- [AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup](https://github.com/AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup): A website for finding tabletop adventures.

#### Documentation I've written

Writing code is not everything. I also regularly contribute to documentation, be it the introduction of new documentation [[1]](https://github.com/schul-cloud/gamification/pull/60) [[2]](https://github.com/free-pdk/free-pdk.github.io/pull/3) [[3]](https://github.com/cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-API/pull/141), [fixing typos](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acmfcmf+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Amerged+typo), or [commenting the code](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/pull/543/files) contribute.

#### Full Stack Projects

- [AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup](https://github.com/AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup): A community-driven website for finding tabletop adventures.  
  âš¡ Fun fact: I prototyped the concept in about a week with the goal of creating a minimal viable product. And it worked, people liked it, and the website went live!   
  *#PHP, #Symfony, #ElasticSearch*
- cmfcmf/CFRC (private repository): A model railroad control software with back- and frontend written in TypeScript
  âš¡ Fun fact: Both server and client are running Redux. All state is synchronized between all clients and the server.  
  *#TypeScript, #Node.js, #Redux, #Material-UI*

#### Libraries I Published

- [cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-API](https://github.com/cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-API): An API wrapper for OpenWeatherMap.org written in PHP.  
  âš¡ Fun fact: This was the first time I ever used namespaces.

#### Contributions I'm particularly proud of

-  ðŸŽ‰ [I contributed to Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/65973)  
  My contribution allows tasks to be configured to run side by side in the same terminal.
-  ðŸŽ‰ [I integrated the Symfony Router into the web framework Zikula](https://github.com/zikula/core/pull/1519).  
  This was a huge task for me at the time and was way more complicated then I expected. 
-  ðŸŽ‰ My [first pull request from 2012](https://github.com/zikula/core/pull/455), which was my first ever contribution to open source software.
