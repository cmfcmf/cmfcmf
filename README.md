## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently mainly working on 
- [cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local): A local/offline search plugin for Docusaurus v2.
- [AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup](https://github.com/AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup): A website for finding tabletop adventures.
- [free-pdk](https://github.com/free-pdk): Reverse Engineering of [Padauk](http://www.padauk.com.tw/) mikrocontrollers.


### Libraries I Published

#### [cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-API](https://github.com/cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-API)

An API wrapper for OpenWeatherMap.org written in PHP.

âš¡ Fun fact: This was the first time I ever used namespaces.

#### [cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local)

Offline search support for documentation created with Docusaurus.

### Documentation I've written

Writing code is not everything. I also regularly contribute to documentation, be it the introduction of new documentation 
[[1]](https://github.com/schul-cloud/gamification/pull/60) 
[[2]](https://github.com/free-pdk/free-pdk.github.io/pull/3) 
[[3]](https://github.com/cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-API/pull/141), 
[fixing typos](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acmfcmf+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Amerged+typo), 
or [commenting the code](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/pull/543/files) 
I contribute.

### Full Stack Projects

#### [AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup](https://github.com/AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup) *#PHP, #Symfony, #ElasticSearch*

A community-driven website for finding tabletop adventures.

âš¡ Fun fact: I prototyped the concept in about a week with the goal of creating a minimal viable product. And it worked, people liked it, and the website went live!   

#### cmfcmf/CFRC (private repository) *#TypeScript, #Node.js, #Redux, #Material-UI*

A model railroad control software with back- and frontend written in TypeScript

âš¡ Fun fact: Both server and client are running Redux. All state is synchronized between all clients and the server.  

#### [zikula/core](https://github.com/zikula/core)

Zikula (previously named PostNuke) is a content management framework written in PHP.
I was one of the lead developers from 
[~2013 to ~2016](https://github.com/zikula/core/graphs/contributors?from=2012-08-15&to=2016-09-22&type=c)
and created more than 
[150](https://github.com/zikula/core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Acmfcmf)
issues and more than
[250](https://github.com/zikula/core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acmfcmf+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acomments-desc)
pull requests during this time. 
One of my biggest projects was 
[integrating the Symfony Router](https://github.com/zikula/core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acmfcmf+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acomments-desc+route).

âš¡ Fun fact: Working on Zikula taught me a lot about the importance of keeping backwards compatibility and all the problems that come with it.

### Community Management

I try to make contributing to my bigger projets 
[cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-API](https://github.com/cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-API) and 
[AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup](https://github.com/AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup/)
as easy and accessible as possible.

I aim to provide easy to setup development environments, including browser-based environments.
I write [extensive contributing guidelines](https://github.com/AdventureLookup/AdventureLookup/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
aimed at both developers and non-developers.
I try to be encouraging and supportive to all contributors, because I know how much of a difference the behavior of people you are interacting with can make.

### Security Vulnerabilies I discovered

Around 2014, I was particularly interested in security vulnerarbilities and eventually found three vulnerabilities on big websites.
While I no longer actively search for vulnerabilities, my knowledge and experience with them often helps me avoid them in code I write and review. 

- I found an Open Redirect Vulnerability on **twitch.tv**, that apparently had already been reported but not yet been fixed.
- I found an Open Redirect Vulnerability on **tumblr.com**, which I eventually received a bounty for.
- I found a way to check if a private repository with a given name exists on **github.com**, which was out of scope of the bounty program at that time. 
  I got some cool GitHub swag though!

### Weird Projects

These are projects that are a bit unusual at first glance :mag:

#### [cmfcmf/MagicMouse](https://github.com/cmfcmf/MagicMouse)

A webbrowser for Squeak/Smalltalk. The webbrowser works by opening Chrome in the background and streaming images from Chrome to Squeak via FFI.

#### [cmfcmf/Anno2018](https://github.com/cmfcmf/Anno2018)

A rewrite of the 20-year old game Anno1602 in TypeScript. This includes reverse engineering ancient file formats as well as analyzing assembler code.

#### PolyCode Editor (private repository)

A code editor written in TruffleSqueak/Smalltalk, that allows you to combine multiple programming languages in the same file.

âš¡ Fun fact: We had to extend the existing text box implementation that could only handle `CR` newlines to also properly support `LF` and `CRLF`. We also wrote a binary viewer.

#### PolyJuS Notebooks (private repository)

Jupyter Notebook-like environment for TruffleSqueak/Smalltalk that lets you use multiple programming languages in one notebook.

âš¡ Fun fact: We wrote a paper! "PolyJuS: a Squeak/Smalltalk-based polyglot notebook system for the GraalVM"

### Contributions/Code I'm particularly proud of

- :tada: [I contributed to Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/65973)  
  My contribution allows tasks to be configured to run side by side in the same terminal.
- :tada: My [first pull request from 2012](https://github.com/zikula/core/pull/455), which was my first ever contribution to open source software.

<!--
- :tada: [The first time I ever wrote a sort algorithm](https://github.com/cmfcmf/RoboRally/blob/5184683c929d396ff5c3df859bcb1d591f7e9b36/Source/Master.nxc#L141-L158)
